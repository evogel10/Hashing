The source code in this assignment can be compiled from the command line in the Terminal.

To compile the program, locate the directory where the files are in and enter: javac EVogelLab2.java ChainHashTable.java ChainingNode.java HashTable.java Stopwatch.java

To run the program, locate the directory where the complied files are in and enter: java EVogelLab2 Input.txt Output.txt

The program will read in the Input.txt file and write to the Output.txt file the hash table created from the input file and the run time of the algorithms in nanoseconds.
